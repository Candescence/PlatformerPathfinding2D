# PlatformerPathfinding2D
2D platformer pathfinding system for Unity, using a basic A* algorithm.

An open-sourced version of a personal sub-project involving the creation of a 2D platformer-centric varation of A* pathfinding, based off princples from an article from Yoann Pignole (http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/YoannPignole/20150427/241995/The_Hobbyist_Coder_3__2D_platformers_pathfinding__part_12.php) and Sebastian Lague's wonderful A* tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE).

# PlatformerPathfinding2D
2D platformer pathfinding system for Unity, using a basic A* algorithm.

An open-sourced version of a personal sub-project involving the creation of a 2D platformer-centric varation of A* pathfinding, based off princples from [an article from Yoann Pignole on 2D platformer pathfinding](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/YoannPignole/20150427/241995/The_Hobbyist_Coder_3__2D_platformers_pathfinding__part_12.php) and [Sebastian Lague's wonderful A* tutorials.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE) Pathfinding agent requires [Prime31's CharacterController2D asset](https://github.com/prime31/CharacterController2D) to work.
